# Changelog

## 1.0.0

- Generic TomSpecs object-model runtime for idiomatic C++ (C++17, RAII):
  section-path grammar, meta-data model loader, reflection/resolution, sparse
  document, validator, and the YAML/Markdown codecs, plus a hand-rolled JSON
  reader/encoder — built on `std::string` / `std::vector` /
  `std::map<std::string, …>` (byte-ordered, matching the C `SomMap`).
- Zero external dependencies (C++ standard library only); validated against the
  shared language-agnostic conformance corpus.
- Packaged with a `Makefile` that builds a static (`.a`) and a shared (`.so`)
  library, emits a `pkg-config` file (`tom_som_cpp_runtime.pc`) whose `Version`
  tracks the model version, and provides `make install` and `make dist`
  (source tarball) targets.
- The version tracks the TomSpecs model version; the runtime is hand-authored
  and its `Makefile` `VERSION` is realigned by
  `tom_specs_clitool/bin/generate_som.dart`.
