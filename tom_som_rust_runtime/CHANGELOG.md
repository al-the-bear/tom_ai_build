# Changelog

## 1.0.0

- Generic TomSpecs object-model runtime for Rust: section-path grammar, meta-data
  model loader, reflection/resolution, sparse document, validator, and the
  YAML/Markdown codecs, plus a hand-rolled JSON reader/encoder.
- Zero external dependencies (Rust standard library only — no `serde` /
  `serde_yaml` / `regex`); validated against the shared language-agnostic
  conformance corpus.
- Packaged as a Cargo crate `tom_som_rust_runtime` with `publish = false`
  (proprietary); `cargo package --no-verify` is the packaging check.
- The version tracks the TomSpecs model version; the runtime is hand-authored
  and its `Cargo.toml` version is realigned by
  `tom_specs_clitool/bin/generate_som.dart`.
